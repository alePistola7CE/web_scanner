Should haves
============
+ Script shortcut to update the tld.
- At the moment only Mozilla TLD list is processed. Make it possible
  to provide a custom list.
- Implement multiple TLD sources (pluggable) and process them all into
  one list/set. Make it possible to make a new plugin and register it in a
  obvious way.
